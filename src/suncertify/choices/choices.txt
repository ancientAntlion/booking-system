1. When looking up records in the DB or writing to the DB, I took the "recNo" variable at face value.

Description :
I look up the record at that row in the file regardless of previous "flags"
In the event that the record at that index in the DB file is marked as deleted, I return a RecordNotFoundException

Reason :
The alternative was to read the "flag" byte at the beginning of each record in order to determine if each record existed
before incrementing the "counter" used to search for the 'n'th record. If the number of rows in the DB file increased 
significantly then this would either cause extra time in the file reader, increasing lock time, blocking out other bookings
OR alternatively it would require reading of large amounts of "DB" data into memory.


2. Decided to use a combination of the "Name" and "Location" as a key for the DB

Description : 
Since I am not using a local memory cache, and there is no "unique key" in the DB schema, I decided name + address should suffice.
